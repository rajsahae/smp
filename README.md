# Smp

My implementation of the Stable Marriage Problem. I did most of it just by reading off the wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem)
When I got stuck, I took some guidance/inspiration from (http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem#Ruby) but my implementation has some small differences.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'smp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install smp

## Usage

You can run the full test of the matching and stability algorithms with "rake test".

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
